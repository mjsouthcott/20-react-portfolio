# React Porfolio

## Description

My previous portfolio page has been refactored to use React. It uses reusable React components and React Router to perform client-side routing to determine what's rendered to the page. It contains two pages: Projects (default) and About. It features a short bio, my contact details, and links to my professional and social media accounts. It's completely responsive, and uses the Bulma CSS framework (https://bulma.io/).
